<p>My blood, my friend, my own..

Happy Birthday to you!

You know I love you, I do.

Thanks for being my brother, thanks for helping me out in those times of needs. Thanks for being beside me. For trusting and believing in me, thank you. I love you wholeheartedly.
I love growing up together. We have great memories, in suffering, in abundance, in lack and in contentment. Thanks for being my friend. I'm grateful to God for being a brother+friend.

Damilola Adedeji

I have a lot to say of you..

I bless your year, it is a blessed year. You are secured from all evil. On your path is no death, you are preserved in safety both in body and soul.

Àbúrò mi àtàtà!
